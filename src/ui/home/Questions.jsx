    question: 'How Does Firebee work?',
    answer: `Firebee uses safe ultra-low energy magnetic signals to gently nudge you into a different mental state.
Every Firebee signal is made by studying real world magnetic signatures. Did you know caffeine has a unique one of a kind magnetic signature? Itâ€™s a relatively unknown fact that every molecule on earth actually has a unique magnetic signature.
Firebee using patented technology is able to take a magnetic signature and play it back through the Firebee headband. When you use the alert signal with Firebee you are actually playing back the magnetic signature of caffeine which our bodies already recognize.
Within minutes of feeling the ultra-low magnetic signal of caffeine our body begins to feel more alert and awake.
Firebee signal is 3000 times less powerful than a smartphone and completely safe to use.`,
